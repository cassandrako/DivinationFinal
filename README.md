Welcome to Divinagamancy, a quiz that helps you discover games for an abundance of different tastes. Regardless of the platform, you will likely find something that you want to play.

Using the RAWG API, I was able to use an API key to access a database of over 200k+ games just by manipulating the access url. Due to the limitations of the API, there are a few paths quiz results that do not have thumbnails. They are primarily within the consoles (Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and Playstation), and either in the RPG, and Simulation genres. 

However, the idea first came about during the first week. I wanted to create a fate quiz for a divination-like spin on video games. I found the RAWG API and then wrote out a logistics tree to see how many HTML and JS files I would need. In hindsight, I could have made the quiz in one Javascript file, however, the HTML method was more comprehendable in my mind.

All in all, the quiz takes you to different games dated from the 1900s, all the way to 2023.
